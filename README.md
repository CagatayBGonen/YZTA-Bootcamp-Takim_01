## 🎮 Game Title: Afterlife Guide

### 🧭 Game Description
*Afterlife Guide* is a narrative-driven puzzle game where the player guides the souls of the departed to their rightful destination in the afterlife. By interpreting emotional clues in NPC dialogue, players must select a symbolic item that represents the soul's unresolved tie to life, and choose the island (Heaven, Hell, or Rebirth) where they belong.

Throughout the journey, players are challenged not only to make meaningful choices, but also to reflect on their own values and judgments. The game combines emotional storytelling with a stylized, atmospheric experience.

<summary>📄 Sprint 1 Review</summary>

### 🎯 Sprint Goal
To establish the foundation of the core gameplay loop and create a testable prototype involving NPC dialogue, symbolic item selection, and destination choice mechanics.

### ✅ Completed Work (Partially)
- Initial structure of NPC and item matching logic implemented
- Item pickup system in development
- Basic feedback results shown via console
- Ship Controle implemented
- Built Low poly ship model + UV Mapping
- Sea Shader Graph created.

### 📉 General Evaluation

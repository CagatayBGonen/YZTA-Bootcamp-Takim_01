## 🎮 Game Title: Spirit Guide

### 🧭 Game Description
*Spirit Guide* is a narrative-driven puzzle game where the player guides the souls of the departed to their rightful destination in the afterlife. By interpreting emotional clues in NPC dialogue, players must select a symbolic item that represents the soul's unresolved tie to life, and choose the island (Heaven, Hell, or Rebirth) where they belong.

Throughout the journey, players are challenged not only to make meaningful choices, but also to reflect on their own values and judgments. The game combines emotional storytelling with a stylized, atmospheric experience.

<summary>📄 Sprint 1 Review</summary>

### 🎯 Sprint Goal
To establish the foundation of the core gameplay loop and create a testable prototype involving NPC dialogue, symbolic item selection, and destination choice mechanics.

### ✅ Completed Work (Partially)
- Initial structure of NPC and item matching logic implemented
- Item pickup system in development
- Basic feedback results shown via console
- Ship Controle implemented
- Built Low poly ship model + UV Mapping
- Sea Shader Graph created.

### 📉 General Evaluation
The sprint was **partially successful**. While progress was made on core systems, the team could not deliver a fully testable prototype. Time management and consistent team communication were the key issues observed.

### 🎯 Goal Achievement
Some progress was made toward the sprint objectives, but the sprint goal was only **partially achieved**.

### 🔄 Suggestions for Improvement
- Improve daily coordination and maintain **consistent Daily Scrums**
- Strengthen internal task tracking and role clarity
- Break down tasks into smaller, deliverable pieces
- Communicate more frequently through Trello and Discord

<summary>🎯 Sprint 2 Review</summary>

🎯 **Sprint Goal**  
Complete core mechanics and produce a playable demo.

✅ **Completed Work (Partially)**  
- World design and terrain elements created  
- Input controls implemented (movement & interaction)  
- Steerable flagpole system for ship navigation completed

- Communicate early when facing blockers or slow progress  
- Collaborate more closely to resolve issues as they arise  
- Work more efficiently and stay aligned with sprint goals  

🚀 **Next Sprint Expectations**  
- Complete remaining mechanics and ensure they function cohesively
